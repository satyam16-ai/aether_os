# Quick Start: Testing AetherOS Multitasking

This guide shows you how to quickly test the multitasking capabilities of AetherOS Phase 4.

---

## Prerequisites

- Linux system with:
  - `gcc` (or `i686-elf-gcc` for cross-compilation)
  - `nasm` (assembler)
  - `ld` (linker)
  - `qemu-system-i386` (x86 emulator)
  - `grub-mkrescue` (ISO creation)

---

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build the kernel
make clean
make

# Run in QEMU
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom build/aether.iso -m 32M
```

You should see the AetherOS boot screen with subsystem status showing TSS initialized.

---

## 5-Minute Multitasking Demo

### Step 1: Check System Status
```
cpu
mem
uptime
```

Verify the kernel is running properly.

### Step 2: Test Paging
```
paging status
paging test
```

View the virtual memory system (don't enable yet, just inspect).

### Step 3: Create Processes
```
ps list
```
You should see only the idle process (PID 0).

```
ps create
```
Creates two test processes: `test_proc_1` (PID 1) and `test_proc_2` (PID 2).

```
ps list
```
Now you should see 3 processes:
- PID 0: idle_process (RUNNING)
- PID 1: test_proc_1 (READY)
- PID 2: test_proc_2 (READY)

### Step 4: View Process Details
```
ps current
```
Shows the currently running process (idle_process).

```
ps info 1
```
Shows detailed information about test_proc_1.

### Step 5: Check Scheduler
```
sched stats
```

You should see:
- Status: DISABLED
- Ready Queue: 2 processes
- List of test_proc_1 and test_proc_2

### Step 6: Enable Multitasking! ðŸš€
```
sched start
```

**This is the moment!** The scheduler activates and processes start switching.

Wait a few seconds...

### Step 7: View Multitasking in Action
```
sched stats
```

You should now see:
- Status: ENABLED
- Current process alternates between processes
- Context Switches counter increasing
- Quantum remaining decreasing from 10 to 0
- Total runtime increasing for all processes

**The system is now multitasking!** Processes switch every 100ms (10 ticks).

### Step 8: Manual Context Switch
```
sched yield
```

This immediately switches to the next ready process. Try it multiple times and use `sched stats` to see the effect.

---

## Advanced: Stress Test (5+ Processes)

### Create Multiple Processes
```
ps create
ps create
ps create
```

This creates 6 test processes (2 per command).

```
ps list
```

You should see PIDs 1-6 all in READY state.

### Enable Multitasking
```
sched start
```

**Previously, this would cause a kernel panic with 5+ processes!**

Now with TSS support, it works perfectly. âœ…

### Watch Them Run
```
sched stats
```

All processes share CPU time fairly. The scheduler rotates through them in round-robin fashion.

---

## Understanding the Test Processes

Both `test_proc_1` and `test_proc_2` execute the same behavior:

```c
void test_process_1(void) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        timer_sleep_ms(1000);  // Sleep 1 second
    }
    process_exit(0);  // Terminate after 50 seconds
}
```

- Each process runs for ~50 seconds
- Then terminates automatically
- State changes: READY â†’ RUNNING â†’ TERMINATED

After 50+ seconds, check:
```
ps list
```

You'll see some processes in TERMINATED state.

## What to Look For

### Success Indicators
âœ… Kernel boots without errors  
âœ… TSS shows as initialized  
âœ… Processes can be created  
âœ… Scheduler enables without crash  
âœ… Context switches every 100ms  
âœ… Statistics update correctly  
âœ… 5+ processes run simultaneously  
âœ… Manual yield works  
âœ… No kernel panics  

### Common Issues

**"Process creation failed"**
- Likely hit the 256 process limit
- Use `ps list` to see current count

**"Scheduler already enabled"**
- Already running, use `sched stop` first

**Kernel panic on boot**
- Rebuild with `make clean && make`
- Check QEMU version (tested with 4.2+)

## Technical Notes

### TSS (Task State Segment)
The TSS enables safe context switching from interrupt handlers:
- Provides kernel stack address per process
- Updated on every context switch: `tss_set_kernel_stack()`
- Required for privilege level transitions (ring 3 â†’ ring 0)

### Context Switching
Happens every 100ms (10 timer ticks) when scheduler is enabled:
- Saves all registers (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, ESP, EBP, EIP, EFLAGS)
- Updates TSS with new process's kernel stack
- Restores registers from new process
- Jumps to new process's EIP

### Scheduler Algorithm
Round-robin with time quantum:
- Each process gets 10 ticks (100ms)
- When quantum expires, process moves to back of queue
- Next ready process gets CPU
- Fair CPU time distribution

---

## Troubleshooting

### Keyboard Not Responding
This was a bug we fixed. If it happens:
- Check that `pic_enable_irq(1)` is called in keyboard_init()
- Verify IRQ 1 is enabled with `irq status` (if you add that command)

### Kernel Panic with Multiple Processes
This was the major bug we fixed with TSS:
- Ensure `tss_init()` is called after `gdt_init()`
- Verify GDT has 6 entries (not 5)
- Check that `tss_set_kernel_stack()` is called before context switch

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean build
make clean
make

# If still failing, check dependencies
which gcc
which nasm
which ld
which qemu-system-i386
```

## Next Steps

After verifying multitasking works:

1. **Read PHASE4_COMPLETE.md** - Technical deep dive
2. **Read TESTING.md** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **Experiment with commands** - Try different combinations
4. **Prepare for Phase 5** - User mode and system calls

---

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

If you've successfully:
- Created multiple processes
- Enabled the scheduler
- Seen context switches happening
- Run 5+ processes simultaneously without crashes

**Congratulations!** You're running true preemptive multitasking on AetherOS!

The foundation for a complete operating system is now in place. Phase 4 is **COMPLETE**! âœ“
