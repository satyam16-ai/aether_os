## Phase 4 Complete: Virtual Memory & Process Management with TSS

This document contains test procedures to verify all Phase 4 functionality.

---

## Test 1: TSS Initialization

**What to test:** Verify Task State Segment is properly initialized.

**Steps:**
1. Boot the kernel in QEMU
2. Check the subsystem status display
3. Verify you see: `[DONE] TSS - Task State Segment`

**Expected Result:**
- Kernel boots without errors
- TSS shows as initialized
- No kernel panic

---

## Test 2: Paging System

**What to test:** Virtual memory with identity mapping.

**Commands:**
```
paging status
paging test
paging enable
```

**Expected Results:**
- `paging status` shows page directory at specific address
- `paging test` shows 4KB pages with Present + RW flags
- `paging enable` activates virtual memory without crash
- After enabling, message: "SUCCESS! Virtual memory is active!"

---

## Test 3: Process Creation

**What to test:** Process Control Block creation and management.

**Commands:**
```
ps list
ps create
ps list
```

**Expected Results:**
- Initial `ps list` shows only idle process (PID 0)
- `ps create` creates two test processes
- Second `ps list` shows:
  - PID 0: idle_process (RUNNING)
  - PID 1: test_proc_1 (READY)
  - PID 2: test_proc_2 (READY)

---

## Test 4: Process Information

**What to test:** Detailed process state inspection.

**Commands:**
```
ps current
ps info 1
ps info 2
```

**Expected Results:**
- `ps current` shows idle_process details
- `ps info 1` shows test_proc_1 with:
  - State: READY
  - Priority: NORMAL (50)
  - 4096 byte stack allocated
  - Registers initialized
- `ps info 2` shows similar for test_proc_2

---

## Test 5: Scheduler Statistics (Before Enable)

**What to test:** Scheduler state before activation.

**Commands:**
```
sched stats
```

**Expected Results:**
- Status: DISABLED
- Algorithm: Round-Robin
- Time Quantum: 10 ticks
- Ready Queue: 2 processes (if you ran `ps create`)
- Lists test_proc_1 and test_proc_2

---

## Test 6: Enable Multitasking (THE BIG TEST!)

**What to test:** Context switching with TSS support.

**Commands:**
```
ps create
sched start
```

**Wait 5-10 seconds, then:**
```
sched stats
```

**Expected Results:**
- After `sched start`: "Scheduler enabled! Multitasking active."
- Kernel does NOT panic (this was the bug we fixed!)
- After waiting, `sched stats` shows:
  - Status: ENABLED
  - Current process alternates between processes
  - Context Switches counter increases over time
  - Quantum remaining decreases from 10 to 0
  - Total runtime increases for all processes

---

## Test 7: Manual Yield

**What to test:** Voluntary context switching.

**Commands:**
```
ps create
sched start
sched yield
```

**Expected Results:**
- "Yielding to next process..."
- "Back from yield."
- Process switches immediately
- No kernel panic

---

## Test 8: Stress Test (5+ Processes)

**What to test:** This previously caused kernel panic!

**Commands:**
```
ps create
ps create
ps create
sched start
```

**Wait 10 seconds, then:**
```
sched stats
```

**Expected Results:**
- 6+ processes created (2 per `ps create`)
- Scheduler enables without crash
- All processes get CPU time
- Context switches happening every 100ms
- No kernel panic! âœ“

---

## Test 9: Process Lifecycle

**What to test:** Process execution to completion.

**Steps:**
1. Create test processes: `ps create`
2. Enable scheduler: `sched start`
3. Wait 60 seconds (test processes run 50 iterations)
4. Check status: `ps list`

**Expected Results:**
- Test processes eventually terminate (exit after 50 iterations)
- State changes from RUNNING â†’ READY â†’ TERMINATED
- Scheduler continues with remaining processes

---

## Test 10: Scheduler Control

**What to test:** Enable/disable scheduler.

**Commands:**
```
sched start
sched stats
sched stop
sched stats
sched start
```

**Expected Results:**
- `sched start` enables multitasking
- First `sched stats` shows ENABLED
- `sched stop` disables scheduler
- Second `sched stats` shows DISABLED
- `sched start` re-enables successfully

âœ… **Task State Segment (TSS):**
- Proper hardware task switching support
- ESP0/SS0 for kernel stack on privilege level change
- GDT entry 5 (selector 0x28)

## Technical Notes

### TSS Implementation

The Task State Segment enables safe context switching from interrupt handlers:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `tss_init()` called after GDT setup
   - TSS structure allocated with ESP0 = current kernel stack
   - SS0 = 0x10 (kernel data segment)
   - Added to GDT as entry 5 (selector 0x28)

2. **Context Switch:**
   - Before switching: `tss_set_kernel_stack(new_process_stack + 4096)`
   - Updates TSS.ESP0 to point to new process's kernel stack top
   - When interrupt occurs in ring 3, CPU loads ESP0 from TSS
   - Ensures safe stack switching on privilege level changes

3. **Why This Fixes the Kernel Panic:**
   - Previous crash: No TSS â†’ undefined stack on privilege change
   - With TSS: Each process has proper kernel stack address
   - CPU uses TSS.ESP0 when entering kernel from user mode
   - No stack corruption during interrupt handling

### Test Process Behavior

Both `test_process_1()` and `test_process_2()` execute 50 iterations:

```c
void test_process_1(void) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        // Each iteration takes ~1 second
        timer_sleep_ms(1000);
    }
    process_exit(0);
}
```

- Each iteration: 1000ms delay
- Total runtime: ~50 seconds
- Then process terminates with `process_exit(0)`
- State changes: READY â†’ RUNNING â†’ TERMINATED

## Success Criteria

Phase 4 is **COMPLETE** if:

1. âœ… Kernel boots with TSS initialized
2. âœ… Paging can be enabled without crash
3. âœ… Processes can be created (multiple processes)
4. âœ… Scheduler can be enabled
5. âœ… Context switching works (no kernel panic)
6. âœ… 5+ processes can run simultaneously
7. âœ… Statistics track CPU time correctly
8. âœ… Manual yield works
9. âœ… Processes can complete and terminate

All criteria met! **Phase 4: DONE âœ“**

## Next: Phase 5

With virtual memory, processes, and multitasking complete, Phase 5 will add:

- **User mode:** Ring 3 execution for processes
- **System calls:** Kernel API for user programs
- **Better process isolation:** Separate address spaces per process
- **Inter-process communication:** Pipes, signals, messages

The foundation is solid! ðŸš€
