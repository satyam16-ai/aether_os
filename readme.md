# 🌌 Aether OS

> **The fully customizable, AI-native operating system built from scratch — designed for creative professionals, developers, and dreamers of intelligent systems.**

Aether OS is a next-generation operating system built entirely from **scratch** in **Assembly, C, and Python**, with **AI and ML infused at every layer**. Inspired by the customizability of Arch Linux and the intelligence of modern AI systems, Aether is a modular, secure, and adaptive OS that evolves with its users.

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy

- **From Scratch**: No Linux, no Unix base. Aether is built from the bootloader up.
- **Fully Customizable**: Like Arch, but more powerful — build only what you need.
- **AI-Native by Design**: AI is not a plugin. It's at the heart of the OS (Sentinel AI).
- **Designed for Real Users**: Creative professionals and developers — not just hobbyists.
- **Local + Cloud AI**: Hybrid AI model with privacy-first local intelligence and cloud extension.

## 🧠 Sentinel AI — The Brain of Aether

Sentinel AI is Aether’s integrated intelligence layer:

- Learns user behavior & adapts UI, performance, and workflows
- Powers natural language system commands & contextual understanding
- Uses ML for memory optimization, prefetching, auto-tagging, and anomaly detection
- Local models for privacy, cloud extensions for power
- Offers explainable actions — logs everything it changes or automates
